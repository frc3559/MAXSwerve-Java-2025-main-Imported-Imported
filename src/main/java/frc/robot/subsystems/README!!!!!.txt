NOTES

Please not that this is a WIP. Notes of things to do are below in order of importance.

Calculate and characterize kS and kV values for feed forwards. Set values in constants class.
    kS must be measured. it is the minimum voltage required for motion to begin, typically very small, fractiions of a volt.
    kV can be calculated, or measured using advantage scope. It is in units of volts/unit/s. 
        Example: A motor spins at 1000 RPM when 12 volts are applied to the motor.
        kV = volts applied divided by the units of speed measured, so 12 / 1000 is a kV of 0.012 Volts per RPM per second.
Calculate conversion factors for encoders.
Build auto functions.
