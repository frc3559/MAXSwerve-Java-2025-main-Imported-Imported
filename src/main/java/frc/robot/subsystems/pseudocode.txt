PSEUDOCODE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ELEVATOR / ARM SUBSYSTEM

Arm and elevator to be controlled by automatic setpoint control and a state machine.

STATE MACHINE
    Will be built as it's own subsystem and each subsystem injected through RobotContainer.
        Injected through RobotContainer to allow access to other subsystem functions without making subsystems globally public.
    Main state machine for end effector will send setpoint commands to each subsystem to control state of end effector.
    Irrational or illegal setpoint commands must be filtered and flagged as illegal or modified to prevent mechanism damage.
    State machine to be continuously called while machine is enabled. Must be called in a way to comply with FRC safety guidlines.
        Handled through RobotContainer Command framework, call in ConfigureBindings and schedule as default command for subsys.
    
ELEVATOR SUBSYSTEM
    Manage height of both stages of elevator.
        Use PIDF control to manage height.
        FF constants need to be calculated and characterized.
        PID must be tuned on site.
    Setpoints sent via state machine.
    Pass telemetry back into RobotContainer to allow monitoring and troubleshooting.
    Handle enable and disable transients smoothly in case of unexpected or improper shutdown.
    Automatic homing routine required to be ran at start of match to home encoders if using internal motor encoders.
        Absolute distance encoders in the pipes.
    ELEVATOR HARDWARE
        Middle Lift
            Motor used to lift stage 1 of elevator.
            Rev NEO V1.1.
            Ratio unknown currently.
            1st stage home is with stage totally collapsed. (0 inches)
            Maximum travel calculated as 33.5 inches.
        Inner Lift
            Motor used to lift stage 2 of elevator.
            Rev NEO V1.1.
            Ratio unknown currently.
            Stage home is with stage totally extended, at top of travel. (19.5 inches)
            Maximum travel is 19.5 inches.
        Middle Lift Encoder
            Internal motor encoder planned for use.
            Distance sensor for absolue position planned in future. Maybe.
        Inner Lift Encoder
            Internal motor encoder planned for use.
            Distance sensor for absolue position planned in future.

ARM SUBSYSTEM
    Manage height of both stages of elevator.
        Use PIDF control to manage height.
        FF constants need to be calculated and characterized.
        PID must be tuned on site.
    Setpoints for arm sent via state machine.
    Grabber to be either on or off.
    Game piece detection TBD.
    Pass telemetry back into RobotContainer to allow monitoring and troubleshooting.
    Handle enable and disable transients smoothly in case of unexpected or improper shutdown.
        Absolute encoder in the pipes.
    ELEVATOR HARDWARE
        Arm
            Motor used to lift arm to desired angle.
            Rev NEO V1.1.
            Ratio unknown.
            Home or "Zero" is with arm totally vertical facing downward.
            Maximum travel calculated at 135 degrees.
        Arm Encoder
            Rev through bore encoder in duty cycle/absolute mode.
        Grabber
            Motor used to intake and outtake game piece.
            Rev NEO V1.1.
            Ratio unknown.
            Motors are to be designed to be either on or off, no setpoint control needed.
            Prox switch or TOF/distance sensor to detect game piece and turn off motors when grabbing.
